Binary Prediction with a Rainfall Dataset
I participated in the Binary Prediction with a Rainfall Dataset competition on Kaggle. The goal was to predict rainfall events (binary classification: "Rain" or "No Rain") based on various meteorological features.

Public Score: 0.86

Private Score: 0.89

This repository contains the code, data analysis, and model training process for this project. The final submission was based on a combination of models, including Naive Bayes, XGBoost, and Ensemble Learning.

Key Steps:
Data preprocessing and cleaning.

Feature engineering and creation of new features.

Model training using different algorithms like XGBoost, LightGBM, and Naive Bayes.

Model evaluation using cross-validation and accuracy metrics.

Final model submission and results evaluation on Kaggle.

Feel free to explore the code and see the steps I followed to achieve this result!
