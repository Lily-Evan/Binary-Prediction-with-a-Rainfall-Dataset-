Binary Prediction with a Rainfall Dataset
This repository showcases my solution to the Binary Prediction with a Rainfall Dataset competition on Kaggle. The challenge involved predicting rainfall events based on various meteorological features, where the task was to classify each day as either "Rain" or "No Rain."

Competition Overview:
Objective: Predict whether it will rain on a given day, based on weather features such as temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure.

Kaggle Public Score: 0.869

Private Score: 0.89

Key Steps in the Process:
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and outliers.

Feature engineering to create meaningful variables from the existing ones.

Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler for model optimization.

Model Development:

Naive Bayes: Implemented for a simple, probabilistic approach to classify the rainfall events.

XGBoost: Applied for a gradient boosting solution, which was tuned for performance.

Ensemble Models: Combined multiple models to improve predictive performance and reduce overfitting.

Model Evaluation:

Evaluated model performance using accuracy metrics and cross-validation.

Fine-tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize results.

The final model was a result of careful model selection and parameter tuning, with an ensemble of classifiers achieving the highest score.

Final Submission:

Created the final predictions using the best-performing models and submitted the results to Kaggle.
